    <h1>The Siberian Husky</h1>
    <p>The Siberian Husky is a very striking breed, and a hard-working dog.
        They are known for their hardiness; they can sleep outside <br>in frigid conditions
        and go for many miles pulling heavy sleds. They thrive on work, and can be destructive
        if not given enough to do.
